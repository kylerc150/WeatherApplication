# WeatherApplication

By: Kyler Conant
This is a weather application that will work with a free API called "Meteomatics" 
   o The application will grab data from the 3 major cities in Arizona and show you the temperature(F) & Wind(m/s).
   o Data will be one single data frame and will also show locations.
   o The application was made semi-scaleable to add more cities.
   o Information is collected hourly and everyday

Future:
   o Possible database collection
   o Adding more cities for more information
   o If paying for API I can collect more information
