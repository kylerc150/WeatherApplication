# WeatherApplication

By: Kyler Conant

This is a weather application that will work with a free API called "Meteomatics" 
   - The application will grab data from the 3 major cities in Arizona and show you the temperature(F) & Wind(m/s).
   - Data will be one single data frame and will also show locations.
   - The application was made semi-scaleable to add more cities.
   - Information is collected hourly and everyday

Future:
   - Possible database collection
   - Adding more cities for more information
   - If paying for API I can collect more information
   - Possible phone app development with this product

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***You must register for the free version of the API***
  - Website: https://www.meteomatics.com/en/api/getting-started/

***To run this code you must:***
  - pip install requests

  - pip install geopy

The image presented in the Github is the application ran after midnight and before 1:00 am, it only shows one run of each city.
